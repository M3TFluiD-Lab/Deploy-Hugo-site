M3TFluiD lab is dedicated to exploring the complex and multidisciplinary nature of climate adaptation and environmental mitigation strategies (CAEMS) in the built environment using fundamental fluid dynamics, advanced data-driven models, and multi-fidelity computational techniques.

The M3TFluiD lab outcomes have a broad range of applications in building energy modeling, advanced air mobility, smart city planning, and renewable energy solutions. These outcomes also support empowering local communities with the required tools and knowledge to use and support CAEMS.
